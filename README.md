# Workshop Demo: Semantic Search with Amazon Titan

## Introduction

I recently had the opportunity to participate in a workshop on implementing semantic search using Amazon Titan. The workshop was a comprehensive exploration of various technologies and tools, and it enabled me to gain a deep understanding and practical experience with implementing advanced features.

## Workshop Overview

The workshop focused on creating a semantic search system using Amazon Titan's capabilities for document retrieval and language modeling. Here are the key components and steps involved:

1. **Data Retrieval**

   The first step was to retrieve PDF documents from URLs using the `urlretrieve` function. The documents used in the workshop were annual shareholder letters from Amazon spanning several years. Each document was associated with metadata, such as the year and source.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   To prepare the PDF documents for analysis, we used the `PdfReader` and `PdfWriter` from the `pypdf` library to extract the text content and reduce the number of pages in each document. This preprocessing step aimed to create cleaner, more manageable data for subsequent analysis.

3. **Document Splitting**

   Next, we learned about document splitting techniques. We used a Recursive Character Text Splitter to segment the text content into smaller, more manageable chunks. This step is essential for creating embeddings and conducting efficient searches.

4. **Building a Vector Database**

   We then utilized Amazon Titan's capabilities to create a vector database. This database was constructed using document embeddings generated from the segmented documents. Amazon Titan's powerful embeddings allowed for efficient and effective search.

5. **Semantic Search**

   We learned how to perform semantic searches using the created vector database. The workshop covered various search techniques, including basic similarity search, similarity search with metadata filtering, top-K matching, and maximal marginal relevance. These search methods provided different ways to retrieve relevant documents based on the query.

6. **Language Model Integration**

   We also integrated Amazon Titan's language model into the search process. The model was used to generate responses to specific queries, enhancing the search results by providing more context and information.

7. **Chain Creation**

   Finally, we created a RetrievalQA chain to automate the search and language model integration process. The chain allowed for querying the vector database and generating responses based on a given context and question.

## Workshop Outcome

Through this workshop, I gained a deep understanding of semantic search systems, document retrieval, document preprocessing, vector databases, and language model integration. I also learned how to create and manage complex chains to automate the search process.

This hands-on experience has equipped me with the knowledge and skills required to implement similar systems in real-world applications. I am now confident in using Amazon Titan's capabilities to create powerful semantic search solutions, benefiting from its document retrieval and language modeling features.
